                Every item holds a story.
                A misplaced phone, a lost ID card, or even a forgotten umbrella might seem small — but for someone, it’s priceless. Whether it’s a student’s certificate, a commuter’s wallet, or a traveler’s bag, the loss creates stress, inconvenience, and sometimes, panic.
                At LFPortal, we believe in restoring more than just belongings — we restore peace of mind. Our platform connects finders and seekers to ensure valuable items make their way back home.
                Because what’s lost… should be found.
