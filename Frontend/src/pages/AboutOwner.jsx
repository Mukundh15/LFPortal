                Hello! I'm <strong>Mukundh</strong>, the creator of <strong>LFPortal</strong>. I'm currently a Computer Science Engineering student passionate about solving real-life problems with the help of technology.
                <br /><br />
                I built this platform to help people find and report lost or found items easily and securely. I enjoy working on full-stack web development, especially using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).
                <br /><br />
                My goal is to create user-friendly applications that can make a meaningful impact. Thank you for visiting LFPortal â€“ I hope it helps you!
